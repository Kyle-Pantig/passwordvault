# Debug Email Verification Issue

## Current Problem
- Clicking verification link redirects to login page instead of verification page
- Verification page should show "Email Verified!" message

## Root Cause
The Supabase redirect URL is set to `http://localhost:3000/` instead of `http://localhost:3000/verify`

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Update Supabase Redirect URL
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
4. Scroll down to **URL Configuration**
5. In **Redirect URLs**, change:
   - FROM: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - TO: `http://localhost:3000/verify`
6. Click **Save**

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Sign up with a new email address
2. Check your email for the verification link
3. Click the verification link
4. You should now be redirected to `/verify` page
5. You should see "Email Verified!" message

### 3. Alternative: Test with Current URL
If you want to test with the current setup, you can manually navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/verify?token=ddf279b14b95001a269a4b8e491fedd40cf53746d4d779fee9bc8c14&type=signup
```

## Expected Flow After Fix
1. User clicks verification link
2. Redirected to `http://localhost:3000/verify?token=...&type=signup`
3. Verification page loads and processes the token
4. Shows "Email Verified!" success message
5. User can click "Continue to Login"

## Verification Page Features
- ✅ Shows loading spinner while processing
- ✅ Shows success message when verified
- ✅ Shows error message if verification fails
- ✅ Provides "Continue to Login" button
- ✅ Provides "Try Again" button for errors

## Common Issues
- **Still redirects to login**: Check that redirect URL is exactly `http://localhost:3000/verify`
- **Verification fails**: Token might be expired (24-hour limit)
- **Page not found**: Make sure `/verify` route exists (it does in your app)

The fix is simple - just update the redirect URL in Supabase settings!
